### How to build and run

- Build frontend
    - `cd frontend`. Run `npm install`, followed by `npm run build`. This uses
    *Vite* to build a bundle that can be served by the backend
    - This can be edited and rebuilt using `npm run dev` to develop on before
    making further changes
- Build server
    - Again; `npm install` followed by `node server.js` to spin it all up

### Roadmap

- ~v0.1: static site~
- deploy to AWS using docker
- v0.2: spotify top artists from api, other mutating frontend data stored
    in json mapped to client using html templating
