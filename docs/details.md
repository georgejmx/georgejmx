# Details

Currently a nodejs backend which serves a frontend. The frontend is built using _Vite_ and includes the _threejs_ package

## Backlog

- TESTING - Unit testing of backend with a focus on descriptors and prisma
- FEATURE - Change so existing descriptors are loaded from database first, then say 7 more are randomly generated rather than pulling 10 new ones each time
